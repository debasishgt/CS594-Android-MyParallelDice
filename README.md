# CS594-Android-MyParallelDice
CS594 - Android Apps Development. First App done in class with Mark Sargent.
This is the implementation of the game PIG as instructed below:
Instructions: Complete the Pig app we started in class.
###
The App: Your app will have two activities, each of which will have the pair of dice and a roll button of the last app, 
plus a readout of your score, your opponent's score, and the points in the current round. It will also have a "hold" button. 
When the hold button is pressed, the turn is ended and the round points are added to the player's score. If the player rolls 
a 1 on either or both dice, then no points are added to the player's score and the turn ends. When a player's turn ends the app 
moves to the other player's activity. Player1's screen will be represented by the main activity, and Player2's screen by a 
separate activity. The game continues until a player reaches a score of 100. A dialog appears (see code in the OnClickListener 
of the first activity) saying that that player has won. 

Code is available here: https://github.com/detroitteatime/android_class/tree/master/Pig/app/src/main

In class we covered the Android information needed to complete the app. Now it's up to you to program the game logic and put 
all the pieces together.  Use the code at the url above, or provide your own. Note that some code might have to get moved or 
altered, but you should be able to do this with what you know now.
